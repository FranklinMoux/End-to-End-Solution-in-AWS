### Create a scalable website with a backend database, dashboards for instances and costs monitoring, and AWS Cost optimization services and tools. Then make architectural changes to bring value of the cloud using AWS services and metrics, Finally use Terraform and AWS CloudFormation to reconfigure the architecture followed with comparaisons.
* 1-> Create security groups, Network ACLs, a database subnet group in a VPC.
* 2-> Create an Amazon RDS/MySQL DB instance.
* 3-> Create a launch template using Amazon EC2 with an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer for the web             server engine and an initial homepage for the website.
* 4-> Make sure that all resources used are tagged.
* 5-> Create a CloudWatch Dashboard to monitor generated activities for the Webserver and database.
* 6-> Generate activites within the services.
* 7-> Analyze for cloud cost recommendations using AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Cost Explorer, and AWS Cost and usage reports
* 8-> Use Terraform and AWS CloudFormation to reproduce the same architecture and analyze costs differences.
* 9-> Make necessary changes to maximize cloud costs while adhering to the pillars of well-architect frameworks.
* 10-> Comparaison of the 3 methods of cloud architecture configuration and their impact on cloud costs.
